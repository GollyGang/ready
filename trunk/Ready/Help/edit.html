<p>
<font size=+1><b>Undo</b></font>

<p>
Lets you undo one or more recent changes, including all editing
changes and generating changes, as well as changes to the
selection, rule, hashing state and layer name.
The number of changes you can undo is limited only by
available memory and disk space.
Multiple changes made by a script are treated like a single change
and will be undone all at once.

<p>
Each layer maintains its own undo/redo history (but cloned
layers share the same undo/redo history).
The current layer's undo/redo history is automatically cleared
after creating a new pattern or opening a pattern file.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Redo</b></font>

<p>
Lets you redo one or more recently undone changes.
Note that the redo history is automatically cleared after
you make a new change; i.e., if you do something like rotate
the current selection, undo the rotation, then edit some cells
or change the selection, you can no longer redo the rotation.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Disable Undo/Redo</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the Undo and Redo items are disabled, and any
existing undo/redo history for the current layer is cleared.
When editing or generating a very large pattern you may want to
temporarily disable undo/redo to speed up some operations.
But be careful using this feature &mdash; if you switch to another
layer when this item is ticked then that layer's undo/redo history
is also cleared.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Cut</b></font>

<p>
Copies the pattern in the current selection to the clipboard
(in RLE format) and then kills all cells in the selection.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Copy</b></font>

<p>
Copies the pattern in the current selection to the clipboard.
The clipboard data is in RLE format.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Clear</b></font>

<p>
Kills all cells in the current selection.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Clear Outside</b></font>

<p>
Kills all cells outside the current selection.
This is often the quickest way to delete escaping gliders.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste</b></font>

<p>
Pastes a pattern stored in the clipboard into the existing pattern.
After selecting this item you'll be asked to click where you want
the paste to occur.
Before clicking you can use keyboard shortcuts to scroll,
change scale, etc.  The keyboard shortcuts normally used to
flip/rotate the selection will instead modify the paste pattern.
You can also type "M" to change the paste mode or "L" to change
the paste location (see below).
To cancel the paste, just click anywhere outside the view area
or hit the escape key.

<p>
Settings in <a href="prefs:edit">Preferences > Edit</a> specify
how to handle rule information in the clipboard pattern.
You can tell Golly not to change the current rule, or only change
the rule if the universe is empty, or always change to the given rule.
Note that a rule change might cause the current algorithm to change.

<p>
The <a href="refs.html">References</a> section has links to
a number of good sources for clipboard patterns.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste Mode</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you choose the logical function used when pasting in
a clipboard pattern.  The choices are Copy, Or and Xor.
Typing "M" will cycle through all these modes, even after selecting
the Paste command.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste Location</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you choose the location of the cursor within the
paste rectangle that appears after selecting the Paste command.
You can choose any corner or the middle of the rectangle.
Typing "L" will cycle through all possible locations, even after
selecting the Paste command.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste to Selection</b></font>

<p>
Pastes a clipboard pattern into the current selection, but only if it will fit.
The paste always occurs at the top left corner of the selection.
This command can be used as a quick check to see if the pattern in the
clipboard matches the pattern in the selection &mdash; if Xor paste mode is
used then all the resulting cells will be dead if the patterns match.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Select All</b></font>

<p>
Selects the entire pattern, assuming there are one or more live cells.
If there are no live cells then any existing selection is removed.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Remove Selection</b></font>

<p>
Removes the current selection (without changing any cell states).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Shrink Selection</b></font>

<p>
Reduces the size of the current selection to the smallest rectangle
containing all of the selection's live cells.
You can hit "s" to shrink the selection <em>and</em> fit it in the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Random Fill (n%)</b></font>

<p>
Randomly fills the current selection with the indicated percentage of live cells.
Use <a href="prefs:edit">Preferences > Edit</a> to change the percentage
(from 1 to 100).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Flip Top-Bottom</b></font>

<p>
The cells in the current selection are reflected about its central
horizontal axis.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Flip Left-Right</b></font>

<p>
The cells in the current selection are reflected about its central
vertical axis.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Rotate Clockwise</b></font>

<p>
The current selection is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about its center.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Rotate Anticlockwise</b></font>

<p>
As above, but the rotation is anticlockwise.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Cursor Mode</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you choose a cursor mode for various editing operations:
drawing cells, picking cell states, selecting cells, moving the view,
and zooming into or out from a clicked cell.
There are other (quicker) ways to change the cursor mode:

<p>
<ul>
<li> Click on the corresponding buttons in the edit bar.
<li> Hit the corresponding function keys (F2 to F7).
<li> Hit "c" to cycle through all the cursor modes.
<li> Press the shift key to temporarily toggle the draw/pick cursors
     or the zoom in/out cursors.
</ul>
