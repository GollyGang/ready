<h3>What is reaction-diffusion?</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a> (after inventing the computer<font size="-1">*</font> and single-handedly winning the war<font size="-1">*</font>) published a paper in 1952 called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_chemical_basis_of_morphogenesis">The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</a>. This showed how chemical morphogens could diffuse through living tissue and drive development in embryos and plants. The key result is that <i>instabilities</i> can arise and form static patterns.
<p>
The timeline below gives some idea of the development of the key ideas.

<h4>Before Turing</h4>

<p>
Open <a href="open:Patterns/heat_equation.vti">heat_equation.vti</a> (click on this link) and set it running. Scroll down in the Info Pane to see the formula: <tt>delta_a = laplacian_a;</tt> This says that the rate of change of chemical a is equal to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator">Laplacian</a> of chemical a. This means that any location that is lower than its neighbors will increase, and any location that is higher than its neighbors will decrease. This equation describes how heat will spread out in a solid or how ink would diffuse through a liquid.
<p>
We compute the Laplacian of each chemical at each location by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">finite differencing</a> with a <i>stencil</i> of radius 1. In 1D this means that for a string of values:
<p>
<center><table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>...</td><td>A</sub></td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>...</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
the Laplacian at B will be given by: A + C - 2B.
<p>
In 2D, for a cell C surround by 4 neighbors N, S, E, W the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-point_stencil">five-point stencil</a> gives a Laplacian of: N + S + E + W - 4C. More sophisticated stencils are possible.
<p>
Having computed the rate of change of the chemical at each location, we then apply the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler method</a> to estimate the new value at some point in the future. Knowing the current value A and the rate of change A' gives:
<p>
<center>
new_A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A + timestep * A'
</center>
<p>
Here, <i>timestep</i> is a value that determines how accurate the resulting simulation will be - smaller values will give more accurate solutions but take longer to compute because more steps are needed to get to the same place. You can change the timestep in our heat equation by scrolling down in the Info Pane to 'timestep' and editing the value. If you set it to much larger than 0.2 then the values quickly diverge, due to numerical instabilities. In general it is important to check that any witnessed behaviour is genuine and not an artefact of a timestep that is too large.
<p>
There are alternatives to the Euler method that allow for larger timesteps (e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge-Kutta_method">Runge-Kutta</a>) but we haven't implemented them yet.

<p>
<h4>Turing</h4>

<p>
Now open <a href="open:Patterns/turing.vti">turing.vti</a>. This system has two chemicals (a and b) which are shown side by side. After a while, spots appear. To see the same system in one dimension, scroll down in the Info Pane to "Dimensions" and edit to set it to 64 x 1 x 1. The line graph shows chemical a in a brighter color. Soon a pattern of peaks and troughs appears, in the same way as the 2D system. (Likewise in 3D, try 32 x 32 x 32.)
