Here are the important file formats used by Golly:

</p>


<p><a name="rle"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Extended RLE format</b></font>

<p>
Golly prefers to store patterns and pattern fragments in a simple
concise textual format we call "Extended RLE" (it's a modified version
of the RLE format created by Dave Buckingham).  The data is run-length
encoded which works well for sparse patterns while still being easy to
interpret (either by a machine or by a person).  The format permits
retention of the most critical data:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The cell configuration; ie. which cells have what values.
<li> The transition rule to be applied.
<li> Any comments or description.
<li> The generation count.
<li> The absolute position on the screen.
</ul>

<p>
Golly uses this format for internal cuts and pastes, which makes it
very convenient to move cell configurations to and from text files.
For instance, the r-pentomino is represented as

<p>
<dd><tt>x = 3, y = 3, rule = B3/S23</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>b2o$2o$bo!</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
I just drew this pattern in Golly, selected the whole thing,
copied it to the clipboard, and then in my editor I did a paste
to get the textual version.  Similarly, data in this format can
be cut from a browser or email window and pasted directly into Golly.

<p>
RLE data is indicated by a file whose first non-comment line starts
with "x".  A comment line is either a blank line or a line beginning
with "#".  The line starting with "x" gives the dimensions of the
pattern and usually the rule, and has the following format:

<p>
<dd><tt>x = <i>width</i>, y = <i>height</i>, rule = <i>rule</i></tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
where <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are the dimensions of the pattern
and <i>rule</i> is the rule to be applied.
Whitespace can be inserted at any point in this line
except at the beginning or where it would split a token.
The dimension data is ignored when Golly loads a pattern, so it need
not be accurate, but it is <em>not</em> ignored when Golly pastes a pattern;
it is used as the boundary of what to paste, so it may be larger or
smaller than the smallest rectangle enclosing all live cells.

<p>
Any line that is not blank, or does not start with a "#" or "x " or
"x=" is treated as run-length encoded pattern data.  The data is
ordered a row at a time from top to bottom, and each row is ordered
left to right.  A "$" represents the end of each row and an optional
"!" represents the end of the pattern.

<p>
For two-state rules, a "b" represents an off cell, and a "o"
represents an on cell.  For rules with more than two states, a "."
represents a zero state; states 1..24 are represented by "A".."X",
states 25..48 by "pA".."pX", states 49..72 by "qA".."qZ", and on up to
states 241..255 represented by "yA".."yO".  The pattern reader is
flexible and will permit "b" and "." interchangeably and "o" and "A"
interchangeably.

<p>
Any data value or row terminator can be immediately preceded with an
integer indicating a repetition count.  Thus, "3o" and "ooo"
both represent a sequence of three on cells, and "5$" means finish the
current row and insert four blank rows, and start at the left side of
the row after that.

<p>
The pattern writer attempts to keep lines about 70 characters long for
convenience when sharing patterns or storing them in text files, but the
reader will accept much longer lines.

<p>
If the File menu's "Save Extended RLE" option is ticked then comment
lines with a specific format will be added at the start of the file
to convey extra information.
These comment lines start with "#CXRLE" and contain keyword/value pairs.
The keywords currently supported are "Pos", which denotes the absolute
position of the upper left cell (which may be on or off),
and "Gen", which denotes the generation count.  For instance,

<p>
<dd><tt>#CXRLE Pos=0,-1377 Gen=3480106827776</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
indicates that the upper left corner of the enclosing rectange is at
an X coordinate of 0 and a Y coordinate of -1377, and that the
pattern stored is at generation 3,480,106,827,776.

<p>
All comment lines that are not CXRLE lines, and occur at the top or
bottom of the file, are treated as information lines and are displayed
when the user clicks the "information" button in Golly's tool bar.
Any comment lines interspersed with the pattern data will not be
displayed.


<p><a name="mc"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Macrocell format</b></font>

<p>
The size of an Extended RLE file is frequently proportional to the
number of cells it contains, yet Golly supports universes that can
contain trillions of cells or more, using hashlife-based algorithms.
The storage of these huge universes, for which Extended RLE is not
feasible, is done by essentially dumping the in-memory compressed
representation of the universe in "Macrocell format".  Since little
translation need be done between external and internal representation,
this format is also used to store backups of universes at certain
points in Golly's operation when using one of the hashlife-based
algorithms.

<p>
The macrocell format has two parts: the header, and the tree.  The
first portion of the file is the header; this contains the format
identifier, the rule, the generation count (if non-zero), and any
comments associated with this file.  The format identifier is a
line that starts with "[M2]" and contains the name and version of
the program used to write it:

<p>
<dd><tt>[M2] (golly 2.0)</tt></dd>

<p>
Following this is any comment lines, which are lines that begin with
'#'.  If the first two characters of a line are '#R', then the
remainder of the line (after intervening whitespace) is the rule for
the pattern.  If the first two characters are '#G', then the remainder
of the line is the current generation count.  Any other line starting
with a '#' is treated as an ordinary comment line.

<p>
Following the header is is a child-first textual representation of a
canonicalized quadtree.  Each line is either a leaf node, or a
non-leaf node.  For two-state algorithms, the leaf nodes contain an
8x8 pixel array in a simplified raster format, left-to-right, then
top-down, with "." representing an empty cell, "*" representing a live
cell, and "$" representing the end of line; empty cells at the end of
each row are suppressed.  No whitespace is permitted; lines
representing leaf nodes for two-state algorithms are recognized
because they start with ".", "*", or "$".  A sample leaf node
containing a glider is:

<p>
<dd><tt>$$..*$...*$.***$$$$</tt></dd>

<p>
For algorithms with more than two states, leaf nodes represent a
two-by-two square of the universe.  They contain five integers
separated by single spaces; the first integer is 1, and the next
four are the state values for the northwest, northeast,
southwest, and southeast values of the square.

<p>
Nodes with children are represented by lines with five integers.  The
first integer is the logarithm base 2 of the size of the square this
node representes; for two-state patterns, this must be 4 or larger;
for multi-state patterns, this must be 2 or larger.  The next four
values are the node numbers of the northwest, northeast, southwest,
and southeast child nodes.  Each of these child nodes must be the
appropriate size; that is, a square one fourth the area of the current
node.

<p>
All nodes, both leaf and non-leaf, are numbered in the order they
occur in the file, starting with 1.  No node number can point to a
node that has yet been defined.  The special node number "0" is
used to represent all squares that have no live cells.

<p>
The total universe represented by a macrocell file is that of the last
node in the file (the root node), which also must be the single node
with the largest size.  By convention, the upper left cell of the
southeast child of the root node is at coordinate position (x=0,y=1).

<p>
Macrocell files saved from two-state algorithms and from multi-state
algorithms are not compatible.


<p><a name="colors"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Rule colors</b></font>

<p>
Whenever Golly switches to a new rule it searches for a matching
<i>rule</i>.colors file and, if found, loads the color information
stored in the file.
Golly looks for the file in <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>
first, then it looks in the supplied Rules folder.
If <i>rule</i>.colors is not found but <i>rule</i> contains one or more
hyphens then Golly searches for <i>prefix</i>.colors, where <i>prefix</i>
consists of all the characters before the final hyphen.  This allows
related rules to share a single .colors file.

<p>
Note that a rule string can contain characters not allowed in file names
("/" and "\"), so Golly will substitute those characters with underscores.
For example, if you wanted to change the colors associated with the rule
12/34/6 then you'd need to create a file called 12_34_6.colors.

<p>
A .colors file is an ordinary text file.
Any blank lines or lines starting with "#" are ignored.
You can specify the RGB colors for one or more states using lines like these:

<p>
<dd><tt>color = 0      &nbsp;48 &nbsp;48      &nbsp;48 &nbsp; (dark gray)</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>color = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;0      128           255 &nbsp; (light blue)</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>color = 2           255      255           255 &nbsp; (white)</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>color = 3           255      128 &nbsp;&nbsp;0 &nbsp; (orange)</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
Golly silently ignores any states that are invalid for the matching rule.
Any text after the final number on each line is ignored.
To specify a color gradient for all live states (all states except 0)
you can use a line like this:

<p>
<dd><tt>gradient = 0 0 255 &nbsp;255 0 0 &nbsp; (blue to red)</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
Note that a .colors file is loaded <i>after</i> switching to the current
algorithm's default color scheme, so you have the choice of completely
changing all the default colors, or only changing some of them.
Use <a href="prefs:color">Preferences > Color</a> to change the default
colors for each algorithm.


<p><a name="icons"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Rule icons</b></font>

<p>
Whenever Golly switches to a new rule it searches for a matching
<i>rule</i>.icons file and, if found, loads the icon bitmaps
stored in the file.
Golly looks for the file in <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>
first, then it looks in the supplied Rules folder.
If <i>rule</i>.icons is not found but <i>rule</i> contains one or more
hyphens then Golly will look for <i>prefix</i>.icons, where <i>prefix</i>
consists of all the characters before the final hyphen.  This allows
related rules to share a single .icons file.

<p>
Note that a rule string can contain characters not allowed in file names
("/" and "\"), so Golly will substitute those characters with underscores.
For example, if you wanted to change the icons associated with the rule
12/34/6 then you'd need to create a file called 12_34_6.icons.

<p>
Golly can load the bitmaps from BMP, GIF, PNG or TIFF files.
The following picture shows how the bitmaps must be arranged:

<p><center><img src="icon_format.bmp"></center></p>

<p>
The top row contains one or more icons of size 15x15, so the total width
must be a multiple of 15.
The bottom row contains icons of size 7x7, where each icon is under the
bottom left corner of its corresponding 15x15 icon.
The 7x7 icons are optional; if not supplied (i.e., the total height is 15
rather than 22) then Golly will create them by scaling down the 15x15 icons.
Scaled icons can look rather ugly, so this isn't recommended.
Pure black (0,0,0) must be used for the areas you want to be transparent.
The non-black areas will be replaced with the current cell's state color.
If the number of icons supplied is fewer than the number of live states
then the last icon is automatically duplicated.  If there are more icons
than required then the extra icons are simply ignored.

<p>
Starting with Golly 2.2, multi-colored icons are supported.
If the entire image uses more than two colors then Golly will display the
icons using the given colors and without doing any substitutions (except for
black areas of course &mdash; they are still converted to the state 0 color).
Even better, if there is no corresponding .colors file then Golly will use
the icon colors to automatically create the colors used in non-icon displays.
It does this by averaging the non-black pixels in each icon.
This means you can store both icon and color information in the one file.
Consider this example:

<p><center><img src="multicolor.bmp"></center></p>

<p>
This set of icons could be used for a 7-state rule.  The first 6 icons
are for states 1 to 6 (as in a black-and-white .icons file).
The 7th icon is optional and is used to specify the color for state 0.
If no .colors file exists for this rule then Golly will set the non-icon
colors for each state like so:

<p><center>
1 = blue, 2 = red, 3 = blue, 4 = red, 5 = purple, 6 = purple, 0 = gray.
</center></p>

<p>
If the 7th icon was not supplied then Golly would use the current
algorithm's default color for state 0 (this is equivalent to having
a .colors file that doesn't set the color of state 0).

<p>
If Golly can't find any rule-specific icons it will use the default
icons associated with each algorithm.  You can change these icons by using
the "Load Icons" button in <a href="prefs:color">Preferences > Color</a>
to load files with the same format described above.  The only difference
is that these files don't require a .icons extension.


<p><a name="table"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Rule tables</b></font>

<p>
Golly allows you to add new rules by creating transition tables stored in
external files.  Given the rule string "Foo", the RuleTable algorithm will
search for a file called Foo.table.
It looks for the file in <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>
first, then it looks in the supplied Rules folder.
Here's a simple example file:

<p>
<dd><tt># Signals (2/3) pass alongside a wire (1):</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>n_states:4</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>neighborhood:vonNeumann</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>symmetries:rotate4</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>var a={2,3}</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>var b={2,3}</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>var c={2,3}</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>a,0,b,1,c,b</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
See the .table files in the Rules folder for more examples.
A detailed specification is available
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheFormat">here</a>.

<p>
Empty lines and anything following the hash symbol "#" are ignored.
These descriptors must appear before other content:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>n_states:</b> specifies the number of states in the CA
(from 0 to n_states-1 inclusive).</li>

<li><b>neighborhood:</b> specifies the cell neighborhood for
the CA update step. Must be one of: <b>vonNeumann</b>, <b>Moore</b>,
<b>hexagonal</b>, <b>oneDimensional</b>.</li> Other neighborhoods are
supported through emulation, using
<a href="open:Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/RuleTableToTree.py">RuleTableToTree.py</a>,
see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/RoadMap">RoadMap</a>
for a full list.

<li><b>symmetries:</b> can be <b>none</b>, <b>permute</b> or one of the symmetries
supported for the neighborhood you have chosen. For a full list, see the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/RoadMap">RoadMap</a>.
</ul>

<p>
The rest of the file contains variables and transitions. Each variable line
should follow the form above to list the states. Variables should appear
before the first transition that uses them. Variables can be used inside later
variables.

<p>
Transition lines should have states or variables separated by commas.
If there are no variables and <b>n_states</b> is less than 11 then the commas
can be omitted. Only one transition (or variable) should appear on each line.
Inputs are listed in the order C,N,E,S,W,C' for the von Neumann neighborhood,
C,N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,C' for the Moore neighborhood, C,N,E,SE,S,W,NW,C' for the
hexagonal neighborhood, and C,W,E,C' for the oneDimensional neighborhood.

<p>
Where the same variable appears more than once in a transition, it stands
for the same state each time. For example, the transition in the example above
expands to the following:
20212->2, 20213->2, 20312->3, 20313->3,
30212->2, 30213->2, 30312->3, 30313->3, and
all 90-degree rotations of those (because of the <b>rotate4</b> symmetry).

<p>A transition can have a variable as its output
(C') if that variable appears more than once in the transition (as in the example above),
so that it has a definite value.

<p>
Rule tables usually don't specify every possible set of inputs. For those
not listed, the central cell remains unchanged.

<p>
Rules are checked in the order given in the file - the first rule that
matches is applied. If you want, you can write rules in the form of general
cases and exceptions, as long as the exceptions appear first in the file.

<p>
(This form of CA rule table representation was inspired by that in Gianluca Tempesti's
PhD thesis:
<a href="http://lslwww.epfl.ch/pages/embryonics/thesis/AppendixA.html">http://lslwww.epfl.ch/pages/embryonics/thesis/AppendixA.html</a>.)

<p>
If you have a C/C++ implementation of a transition function, there is a
way to automatically produce a rule table file.
See <a href="edit:Rules/TableGenerators/make-ruletable.cpp">Rules/TableGenerators/make-ruletable.cpp</a> for instructions.

<p>
To share your rule tables with others, you can archive them at the public
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/">Rule Table Repository</a>.


<p><a name="tree"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Rule trees</b></font>

<p>
Golly permits the loading of rules from external files, where those
files are in RuleTree format.  If a rule named "Foo" is requested,
Golly will search for Foo.tree and, if found, load the rule from that file.
It looks for the file in <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>
first, then it looks in the supplied Rules folder.

<p>
Golly includes programs that permit you to transform a
given transition function in C++, Perl, or Java into a RuleTree file
(see Rules/TreeGenerators) if the number of states is sufficiently
small (approximately 10 states for eight-neighbor rules, and 32 states
for four-neighbor rules).  Essentially, the RuleTree format allows you
to add your own rules to Golly without needing to know how to
recompile Golly and without dealing with the intricacies of external
libraries; it generates relatively compact files, and the data
structure is designed for very fast execution.

<p>
A rule tree is nothing more than a complete transition table for a
rule, expressed in a compressed, canonicalized tree format.  For an n
state rule, each tree node has n children; each child is either
another tree node or a next state value.  To look up a function of m
variables, each of which is a state value, you start at the root node
and select the child node corresponding to the value of the first
variable.  From that node, you select the child node corresponding to
the value of the second variable, and so on.  When you finally look up
the value of the final variable in the last node, the result value is
the actual next state value, rather than another node.

<p>
The RuleTree format has fixed the order of variables used for these
lookups.  For a four-neighbor rule, the order is always north, west,
east, south, center; for an eight-neighbor rule, the order is always
northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast, north, west, east, south,
center.

<p>
Without compression, for an n-state rule, there would be a total of
1+n+n^2+n^3+n^4 nodes for a four-neighbor rule, and 1+n+...+n^8 for an
eight-neighbor rule; this could quickly get unmanageable.  Almost all
rules show significant redundancy, with identical rows in the
transition table, and identical nodes in the rule tree.  To compress
this tree, all we do is merge identical nodes, from the bottom up.
This can be done explicitly as we construct the tree from a transition
function (see Rules/TreeGenerators/RuleTreeGen.java) or symbolically
as we evaluate a more expressive format.

<p>
The RuleTree format itself is simple, and has similarities to the
macrocell format.  It is not intended for human authorship or
consumption.  The RuleTree format has two parts: a header, and the
rule tree itself.  The header consists of comments (lines starting
with a "#") that are ignored, and three required parameter values
that must be defined before the first tree node.  These values are
defined, one per line, starting with the parameter name, then an
equals sign, and finally an integer value.  The three parameters
are num_states, which must be in the range 2..256 inclusive,
num_neighbors, which must be 4 or 8, and num_nodes, which must
match the number of node lines in the file.

<p>
The tree is represented by a sequence of node lines.  Each node line
consists of exactly num_states integers separated by single spaces.
The first integer of each node line is the depth of that node, which
must range from 1..num_neighbors+1.  The remaining integers for nodes
of depth one are state values.  The remaining integers for nodes of
depth greater than one are node numbers.  Nodes are numbered in the
order they appear in the file, starting with zero; each node must be
defined before its node number is used.  The root node, which must
be the single node at depth num_neighbors+1, must be the last node
defined in the file.

<p>
For comparison purposes, the program "RuleTableToTree" is supplied
with Golly; this executable will convert a rule table file into a rule
tree file.  It operates symbolically (it does not enumerate all the
possibilities) so it should be fast on any rule table.  To use it,
change to the main golly directory (the directory that contains the
Rules directory); this is probably where the executable is installed.
Type

<p>
<dd><tt>RuleTableToTree Codd &gt;Rules/Codd.tree</tt></dd>

<p>
to convert the Codd rule table file (as an example) to a rule
tree file.  Now you can load a Codd universe into either the
RuleTable or the RuleTree algorithm.


<p><a name="naming"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Rule naming conventions</b></font>

<p>
When naming a .table or .tree file it's best to stick to the following
conventions, especially if you'd like to share the file with other Golly users:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Please capitalize all rule names and create files like Foo.table rather
than foo.table.  This helps to emphasize that rule names are important,
especially on case-sensitive file systems.  If the rule "foo" is
specified inside a .rle or .mc file then Golly won't be able to find
Foo.table on a case-sensitive system like Linux.

<li>
To allow for possible future extensions in the way Golly handles rule names,
it's best to use only letters and digits (and possibly hyphens &mdash; see
the next item).  Note in particular that spaces and colons must not be used.

<li>
If you have a number of closely related rules then you might want to start
each name with the same prefix followed by a hyphen and a unique suffix.
All such rules can then share a single .colors and/or .icons file that
uses the same prefix.  For example, Foo-1.table and Foo-2.table can
share Foo.colors and Foo.icons (but if Foo-1.colors also exists then that
file takes precedence for the Foo-1 rule).
</ul>


<p><a name="zip"></a>&nbsp;<br>
<font size=+1><b>Zip files</b></font>

<p>
Golly can open a standard zip file and process its contents in the
following way:

<p>
If the zip file is "complex" then Golly builds a temporary HTML file with
special <a href="help.html#links"><b>unzip</b></a> links to each included file
and shows the result in the help window.  A complex zip file is one that contains:

<p>
<ul>
<li> Any folders.
<li> Any rule-related files (.colors or .icons or .table or .tree extension).
     All such files are automatically extracted and installed into
     <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>.
<li> Any HTML files (.htm or .html extension).
<li> Any text files (.txt or .doc extension, or a name containing "readme").
<li> Multiple scripts (.pl or .py extension).
<li> Multiple patterns.
</ul>

<p>
If the zip file contains at most one pattern and at most one script, Golly
will load the pattern (if present) and then run the script (if present).
For security reasons, if the zip file was downloaded via a
<a href="help.html#links"><b>get</b></a> link then Golly will ask
if you really want to run the included script.
Both the pattern and the script must be at the root level of the zip file;
ie. not inside a folder.
For an example of such a zip file, open
<a href="open:Patterns/WireWorld/Langtons-ant.zip">Langtons-ant.zip</a>
from the Patterns/WireWorld/ folder.  This zip file contains a pattern file
and a simple Python script that sets up a nicer initial view and step size.

<p>
A number of pattern collections in the form of zip files can be downloaded
from the <a href="archives.html">online archives</a>.
