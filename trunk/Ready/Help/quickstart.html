if you've got OpenCL installed.
Either install the latest drivers for your graphics card, or install one of the SDKs from

<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/vcsource-tools-opencl-sdk/">Intel</a>
that will work with your CPU.
Use the commands at the bottom of the Action menu to examine the OpenCL devices available.
