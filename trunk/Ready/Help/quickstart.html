<p>Ready is a program for exploring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction-diffusion_system">reaction-diffusion</a> systems.</p>

<p>Click on the files in the Patterns Pane to see some different systems.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL">OpenCL</a> demos will only work
if you've got OpenCL installed.
Either install the latest drivers for your graphics card, or install one of the SDKs from
<a href="http://developer.amd.com/appsdk">AMD</a> or
<a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/vcsource-tools-opencl-sdk/">Intel</a>
that will work with your CPU.
Use the commands at the bottom of the Action menu to examine the OpenCL devices available.

<h4>2. Interacting with the rendered scene</h4>

<h4>3. Working with the windows</h4>
