<p>
Thanks also to the many programmers who have contributed to the following open source
projects used in Ready:

Early versions of Ready were based on 
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/reaction_diffusion/reaction_diffusion.html">Greg Turk's reaction-diffusion code</a>.

==begin==

Make spots and stripes with reaction-diffusion.

The spot-formation system is described in the article:

  "A Model for Generating Aspects of Zebra and Other Mammailian
   Coat Patterns"
  Jonathan B. L. Bard
  Journal of Theoretical Biology, Vol. 93, No. 2, pp. 363-385
  (November 1981)

The stripe-formation system is described in the book:

  Models of Biological Pattern Formation
  Hans Meinhardt
  Academic Press, 1982

<p>
Your name here. Ready is a community project, so you own it as much as we do.
Make a suggestion, report a bug, add a demo or just give some feedback.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Pattern competition!</b></font><a name="competition"></a>

<p>
Send us an interesting pattern file. Winners will get their patterns included in the next release
of Ready, and have their name mentioned in the credits.
<p>
Rules:
<ul>
<li>Patterns should contain good descriptions.
<li>Patterns should ideally have small file sizes (e.g. under 100k)
<li>Patterns should be freely distributable under our <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL3</a> license.
<li>Competition categories:
<ul>
<li>Best science pattern: showing some phenomenon reported in a published paper.
<li>Most original: some new behavior we haven't seen before.
<li>Prettiest
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Deadline: shortly before the next release.
