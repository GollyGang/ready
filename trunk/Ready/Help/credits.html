Mention Alan Turing and others!!!???.

<font size=+1><b>The programmers</b></font>

<p>
Tom Rokicki wrote most of the complicated stuff.
Golly is essentially the merging of two of Tom's programs (hlife and qlife).
The HashLife algorithm is based on an idea by Bill Gosper.
The QuickLife algorithm uses some ideas from Alan Hensel.
David Eppstein provided the idea on how to emulate B0 rules.

<p>
Andrew Trevorrow wrote the cross-platform GUI code using
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.
Much thanks to Julian Smart and all the other wxWidgets developers.

<p>
Golly's scripting capabilities were inspired by the generosity and efforts of
Eugene Langvagen (author of <a href="http://plife.sourceforge.net/">PLife</a>),
Larry Wall (creator of <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>)
and Guido van Rossum (creator of <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>).

<p>
Tim Hutton wrote the RuleTable algorithm and created the excellent
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/">Rule Table Repository</a>.

<p>
Various code improvements have been contributed by Dave Greene, Jason Summers,
Maks Verver and Robert Munafo.

<p>
