<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 2.3 (released November 2011)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> QuickLife and HashLife support rules using the von Neumann neighborhood or the
     hexagonal neighborhood.  More details <a href="Algorithms/QuickLife.html">here</a>.
<li> The default icon for most rules is now a circular dot rather than a diamond.
     A diamond is the default icon for rules using the von Neumann neighborhood
     and a slanted hexagon is the default icon for rules using the hexagonal neighborhood.
<li> A number of new script commands have been added to allow mouse interaction
     and better keyboard interaction: <a href="python.html#getevent">getevent</a>,
     <a href="python.html#doevent">doevent</a> and <a href="python.html#getxy">getxy</a>.
     The getkey and dokey commands still work but are deprecated.  In particular, there
     is no longer any need for scripts to call dokey(getkey()).
     See the description of <a href="python.html#getevent">getevent</a> for more details.
<li> Some scripts have been added to take advantage of the new commands:
     <a href="open:Scripts/Python/draw-lines.py">draw-lines.py</a>,
     <a href="open:Scripts/Python/flood-fill.py">flood-fill.py</a>,
     <a href="open:Scripts/Python/move-object.py">move-object.py</a> and
     <a href="open:Scripts/Python/move-selection.py">move-selection.py</a>.
<li> New patterns: <a href="open:Patterns/Turmites/ComputerArt.rle">ComputerArt.rle</a>, 
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/CrittersCircle.rle">CrittersCircle.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/CrittersOscillators.rle">CrittersOscillators.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/HPP.rle">HPP.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/HPP_large.rle">HPP_large.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/Sand-Test.rle">Sand-Test.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/TMGas.rle">TMGas.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/TMGas_largeWithHole.rle">TMGas_largeWithHole.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/TripATron.rle">TripATron.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Margolus/TripATron_BlockAligned.rle">TripATron_BlockAligned.rle</a>.
<li> Scripts that create table/tree files have been moved into Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators.
<li> <a href="open:Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/Langtons-Ant-gen.py">Langtons-Ant-gen.py</a> 
     now accepts turns 'U' and 'N' (U-turn and no-turn) as well as 'L' and 'R'.
<li> The hash() command uses a better hash function in a two-state universe.
<li> Pattern rendering is faster at scales 1:16 and 1:8, especially in the Linux app.
<li> The mouse wheel now zooms in/out from the current cursor location rather than the
     middle of the viewport.
<li> Patterns can be saved as gzipped files (*.rle.gz or *.mc.gz).
<li> If an algorithm can save patterns in macrocell format (currently all except QuickLife)
     then the Save Pattern dialog now prefers that format over RLE; ie. the file type order
     is *.mc, *.mc.gz, *.rle, *.rle.gz.
<li> While waiting for a paste click, the keyboard shortcuts for flipping or rotating
     a selection now modify the paste pattern rather than the current selection.
<li> Fixed a bug in Win and Linux apps that prevented keyboard shortcuts being used
     while waiting for paste click.
<li> Pasted patterns are no longer truncated if the RLE header info is incorrect.
<li> Quitting Win app no longer clears clipboard.
<li> Fixed unwanted cursor changes while running a script.
<li> Fixed bug if layer was changed while recording a timeline.
<li> Fixed bug in EmulateMargolus.py when using square4_* neighborhoods.
<li> Removed emulate-Margolus-table.py script (use RuleTableToTree.py instead).
<li> Fixed bug that could result in all buttons and menus being disabled after hitting
     the tool bar's Reset button.
<li> Fixed cursor problems if shift key is used in a keyboard shortcut.
<li> The Mac app now runs on Lion (10.7).  There are two Mac apps: a 64-bit version for
     10.6 and 10.7 (based on Cocoa), and a 32-bit version for 10.4 and 10.5 (based on Carbon).
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 2.2 (released November 2010)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Golly supports bounded grids with various topologies (plane, torus, Klein bottle, etc.).
     Such grids are created by adding a special suffix to the usual rule string.
     The details are in <a href="bounded.html">Help > Bounded Grids</a>.
<li> Two new script commands, <a href="python.html#getwidth">getwidth</a> and
     <a href="python.html#getheight">getheight</a>, return the size of the current grid.
<li> The new scripts, <a href="open:Scripts/Python/make-torus.py">make-torus.py</a> and
     <a href="open:Scripts/Perl/make-torus.pl">make-torus.pl</a>, can be used to
     convert the current selection into a toroidal universe.
<li> Any BOARD and WRAP settings in an MCell file are now obeyed
     (e.g. <a href="open:Patterns/Generations/Bloomerang.mcl">Bloomerang.mcl</a>).
<li> Golly can record and play back a pattern's "timeline", a sequence of steps saved by the new
     <a href="control.html#record">Start Recording</a> item in the Control menu.
     Use the <a href="control.html#deltime">Delete Timeline</a> item to delete a timeline.
     Timelines are supported by all the hashlife-based algorithms (ie. all except QuickLife).
<li> <a href="view.html#timeline">Show Timeline</a> in the View menu toggles the new
     timeline bar below the viewport window.
<li> If a timeline exists when you save a .mc file then <em>all</em> the steps will be stored
     in the file.  On opening such a file, Golly will load the timeline and automatically
     show the timeline bar.
<li> Multi-color icons are supported and allow both icon and color information to be stored
     in the one file (more details <a href="formats.html#icons">here</a>).
<li> Rule tables now support hexagonal and oneDimensional neighborhoods and the permute symmetry.
<li> Added a section on <a href="formats.html#naming">naming conventions</a> for .table and .tree files.
<li> Added a new Python script, <a href="edit:Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/make-ruletree.py">make-ruletree.py</a>,
     that allows you to write rules in Python and have them installed in the form of .tree files.
     See the comments at the top of the script.
<li> Added <a href="open:Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/RuleTableToTree.py">RuleTableToTree.py</a> for converting
     rule tables to trees. It provides emulation for several neighborhoods not natively supported by
     Golly: triangularVonNeumann, triangularMoore, Margolus, etc.
     More details <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruletablerepository/wiki/RoadMap">here</a>.
<li> New Turmite scripts, e.g. <a href="open:Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/Turmite-gen.py">Turmite-gen.py</a>, for
     generating rule trees and icons for relative- and absolute-movement turmites on square,
     hexagonal and triangular grids.
<li> The goto.py script is much faster (thanks to PM 2Ring).
<li> Hitting escape aborts a script that has called a lengthy run() or step() command.
<li> Langtons-Ant.table has been replaced with Langtons-Ant.tree.  The new rule is faster, handles
     multiple ants correctly, and matches most other implementations of this CA.
<li> Reorganized the Patterns folder: moved Conway's Life patterns into Life subfolder,
     moved rule subfolders out of Other-Rules to top level under Patterns, added Life-Like folder.
<li> Added new Turmite patterns, e.g.
     <a href="open:Patterns/Turmites/WormTrails.rle">WormTrails.rle</a>.
<li> Other new patterns: <a href="open:Patterns/Other-Rules/golly-ants.rle">golly-ants.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Other-Rules/Langtons-Ant.rle">Langtons-Ant.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/JvN/JvN-loop-replicator.rle.gz">JvN-loop-replicator.rle.gz</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/Life/Signal-Circuitry/Herschel-conduit-stamp-collection.rle">Herschel-conduit-stamp-collection.rle</a>,
     <a href="open:Patterns/JvN/Boustrophedon-replicator.rle">Boustrophedon-replicator.rle</a>.
<li> Increased the maximum base step from 10,000 to 2,000,000,000.
<li> <a href="keyboard.html">Help > Keyboard Shortcuts</a> lists unassigned actions at the end.
<li> The drawing state can be changed by creating keyboard shortcuts for two new actions called
     Next Higher State and Next Lower State (see <a href="prefs:keyboard">Preferences > Keyboard</a>).
<li> You can turn off the beep sound by unticking the option at the bottom of
     <a href="prefs:edit">Preferences > Edit</a>.
<li> Loading a pattern won't proceed if the "save changes" dialog appears and you select
     Save but then decide to cancel the "save pattern" dialog.
<li> Fixed bug that caused cells to be created in the wrong location when editing very large patterns.
<li> Fixed bug drawing incorrect selection rectangle if very large.
<li> Fixed cursor problem if the shift key is used in a keyboard shortcut to open a dialog/window.
<li> Fixed weird bug on Mac that could cause the viewport to lose keyboard focus after
     clicking in the layer bar's "delete layer" button.
<li> Fixed undo history getting out of sync if you tried to reset to a saved starting pattern
     that had been deleted.
<li> Fixed a bug drawing incorrect icons when layers are stacked.
<li> Fixed a bug not updating the paste image when colors are inverted.
<li> Fixed a problem with the hash() command in a multi-state universe.
<li> Fixed problems using a keyboard shortcut or menu command while a script is running.
<li> Dropped support for Mac OS 10.3.9.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 2.1 (released September 2009)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Golly can download patterns, rules and scripts from various
     <a href="archives.html">online archives</a>.  You can change the location of downloaded
     files using the new button at the bottom of <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>.
<li> Zip files can be opened and processed as described <a href="formats.html#zip">here</a>.
<li> If the mouse moves over a link in the help window then the link reference is
     displayed at the bottom of the window.  Ditto for links in the Set Rule dialog.
<li> The algorithm info in the Set Rule dialog can now be accessed from the new
     <a href="algos.html">Algorithms</a> help item.
<li> Translucent buttons for speed/scale/scroll functions now appear in a corner of the
     viewport whenever the mouse moves over that corner.  The initial location is the
     top left corner, but you can use <a href="prefs:view">Preferences > View</a>
     to specify any other corner or disable the buttons.
<li> Layer bar buttons now show each layer's name rather than its numeric position.
<li> New rules: Codd2, Devore, DLA, Ed-rep, LifeHistory, Perrier, Sand.
<li> New patterns in Other-Rules/, Other-Rules/Codd/, Other-Rules/Codd/Devore/,
     Other-Rules/Margolus/, Loops/.
<li> New scripts: FredkinModN-gen.py, make-Devore-tape.py,
     Margolus/emulate-Margolus-table.py, Margolus/convert-MCell-string.py.
<li> All Python scripts now need to explicitly import the golly module.
     This wasn't strictly necessary in previous versions, but only because it was
     an undesirable side-effect of the way Golly ran scripts.
<li> The <a href="python.html#open">open</a> command can now be used to run a given
     Perl/Python script.
<li> New scripting commands: <a href="python.html#opendialog">opendialog</a>,
     <a href="python.html#savedialog">savedialog</a>,
     <a href="python.html#getclipstr">getclipstr</a>,
     <a href="python.html#setclipstr">setclipstr</a>,
     <a href="python.html#getdir">getdir</a>,
     <a href="python.html#setdir">setdir</a>.
<li> The appdir and datadir commands are deprecated; use the new getdir command.
<li> The color of dead cells (state 0) is now handled like all other states, so
     it's possible for each algorithm/rule to have a different background color.
<li> The <a href="python.html#setcolors">setcolors</a> and
     <a href="python.html#getcolors">getcolors</a> commands can be used to
     set/get the color of state 0.
<li> Golly restores a layer's default colors whenever you create a new pattern
     or open a pattern file (and not just if the algorithm or rule changes).
     If you have any scripts that use <a href="python.html#setcolors">setcolors</a>
     then make sure it is called <em>after</em> calling new/open.
<li> The base step can now be changed temporarily via the new Set Base Step dialog
     in the Control menu.  Golly will restore the default base step
     (set in <a href="prefs:control">Preferences > Control</a>) when you create
     a new pattern, open a pattern file, or switch to a different algorithm.
<li> The <a href="python.html#setbase">setbase</a> command also changes the base step
     temporarily, so if you have any scripts that use setbase then make sure it is
     called <em>after</em> calling new/open/setrule/setalgo.
<li> The <a href="python.html#setoption">setoption</a>/<a href="python.html#getoption">getoption</a>
     commands can use "drawingstate" to set/get the edit bar's current drawing state,
     and they can use "restoreview" to set/get the state of the "Reset/Undo will restore view"
     option set in <a href="prefs:view">Preferences > View</a>.
<li> Paste now supports "And" mode.
<li> The RLE reader allows alphabetic characters other than "o" to represent live cells.
<li> Menu items can show single-character keyboard shortcuts.
<li> When a lexicon pattern is loaded, Golly automatically switches the current rule
     to B3/S23 (and changes the algorithm to QuickLife, if necessary).
<li> Fixed a bug with Random Fill.  Golly wasn't initializing the seed, so the internal
     rand() calls were returning the same sequence of "random" integers each time!
<li> Fixed a bug that prevented the <a href="python.html#getkey">getkey</a> command
     from returning uppercase letters.
<li> Fixed oscar.pl/py to handle B0-and-not-S8 rules correctly (they no longer report
     some spaceships to be stable patterns).
<li> Fixed a couple of bugs when duplicating a layer's undo/redo history.
<li> Fixed crash in Mac app if a script saved a pattern and the progress dialog appeared.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 2.0 (released December 2008)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Golly now supports multiple algorithms and multi-state universes (up to 256 states).
<li> The Generations algorithm supports an entire family of new rules, including
     Brian's Brain (/2/3), Star Wars (345/2/4), and Transers (345/26/5).
<li> The JvN algorithm implements John von Neumann's classic 29-state CA,
     plus a couple of 32-state variants created by Renato Nobili and Tim Hutton.
     See Patterns/JvN for a variety of self-replicators.
<li> The RuleTable and RuleTree algorithms allow you to add new rules by creating
     .table and .tree files and storing them in the Rules folder or
     <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>.
     A number of example rules are supplied, including Langtons-Loops, Evoloop,
     LifeOnTheEdge and WireWorld.
<li> The tool bar has a new button for switching algorithms, or you can use the
     Set Algorithm submenu in the Control menu.  The Use Hashing option has been removed.
<li> The Control > Set Rule dialog also has a menu for changing the current algorithm.
     A help button can be used to expand the dialog and display information
     about the current algorithm, along with examples of the rules it supports.
<li> Golly can read some MCell files (if an algorithm supports the given rule).
<li> The ten layer-specific colors have been replaced by a more flexible approach
     to cope with multi-state universes.  Each algorithm has a default color scheme
     that can be changed in <a href="prefs:color">Preferences > Color</a>.
<li> Each algorithm also has a default set of icons, small bitmaps that are only
     drawn at scales 1:8 and 1:16, and only if the Show Cell Icons option
     (in the View menu) is ticked.  The default icons can be changed by using the
     Load Icons button in <a href="prefs:color">Preferences > Color</a>.
<li> Rule-specific colors and icons can be created by adding suitably named
     .colors and .icons files to the Rules folder or
     <a href="prefs:control">your rules folder</a>.
     Golly looks for these files whenever it switches to a new rule.
<li> The Layer > Set Layer Colors dialog can change one or more colors used by
     the current layer (and its clones).  These changes are temporary and only remain
     in effect while the layer exists, or until the layer's algorithm or rule changes.
<li> The View > Swap Cell Colors option has been changed to Invert Colors.
<li> New script commands have been added to support the above changes:
     <a href="python.html#setalgo">setalgo</a>,
     <a href="python.html#getalgo">getalgo</a>,
     <a href="python.html#numalgos">numalgos</a>,
     <a href="python.html#numstates">numstates</a>,
     <a href="python.html#join">join</a>,
     <a href="python.html#setcolors">setcolors</a> and
     <a href="python.html#getcolors">getcolors</a>.
<li> Some script commands have been modified to handle multi-state patterns.
     Perl users should read the section on <a href="perl.html#cellarrays">cell arrays</a>.
     Python users should read the section on <a href="python.html#celllists">cell lists</a>.
<li> The <a href="python.html#getrule">getrule</a> command now returns a canonical rule string.
<li> The <a href="python.html#setcursor">setcursor</a>/<a href="python.html#getcursor">getcursor</a>
     commands now accept/return strings.
<li> Modified oscar.pl to use arbitrarily big integers.
<li> It's now possible to open a pattern or run a script from the Help window
     by clicking on special links.  For example,
     open <a href="open:Patterns/Life/Guns/golly-ticker.rle">golly-ticker.rle</a>
     or run <a href="open:Scripts/Python/bricklayer.py">bricklayer.py</a>.
<li> Diagonal scrolling is supported.  Open <a href="prefs:keyboard">Preferences > Keyboard</a>
     and assign keys to the new scrolling actions: Scroll NE/NW/SE/SW.
<li> A new check box in <a href="prefs:view">Preferences > View</a> can tell
     Reset/Undo not to restore the view.
<li> View > Show Edit Bar toggles the new edit bar.  The cursor mode buttons have been moved
     from the tool bar into the edit bar.
<li> View > Show All States toggles the display of colors and icons for all states
     in the current universe.  A box is drawn around the current drawing state.
<li> <a href="formats.html">Help > File Formats</a> describes the various file formats used by Golly.
<li> Rendering speed in the Mac and Linux apps has been improved.
<li> Fixed a problem with ampersands not being displayed in the recent pattern/script menus.
<li> Fixed a bug in the Linux/GTK app if a recent pattern/script path contained an underscore.
<li> The Linux and Win apps require Perl 5.10 or later to run .pl scripts
     (older Perl versions are not binary compatible).
<li> The Linux/X11 app is no longer supported due to limitations in wxX11.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 1.4 (released May 2008)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Editing and other actions are now allowed while generating a pattern.
<li> Golly saves files in the standard user-specific data directory on each platform
     rather than in the application directory.  However, you can still keep
     the GollyPrefs file in the application directory if you prefer that option.
<li> Right-click or control-click on a pattern/script file to open the file in
     a text editor.  Use the new button in <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Added unlimited undo/redo; see the <a href="edit.html">Edit Menu</a> help
     for details.  For consistency with Undo, the Reset item now restores
     the starting selection and layer name.
<li> Keyboard shortcuts are now configurable using
     <a href="prefs:keyboard">Preferences > Keyboard</a>.
     Note that you can also specify key combinations to open a pattern,

<li> The Open/Run Recent submenus show relative paths for files inside the Golly folder.
<li> Added a Clear Missing Files item to the Open/Run Recent submenus.
<li> The Control menu's Go and Stop items have been replaced by a single Start/Stop
     item for consistency with the tool bar's start/stop button.
<li> The Control menu has a Set Generation item for changing the generation count,
     or you can click in the "Generation=..." text in the status bar.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 1.2 (released April 2007)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Golly supports multiple layers;
     see the new <a href="layer.html">Layer Menu</a> help for details.
<li> Added <a href="python.html#layers">layer-related scripting commands</a>.
     See heisenburp.py and envelope.py in the Scripts folder for how these
     commands can be used.
<li> Added other useful scripting commands:
     <a href="python.html#exit">exit</a>,
     <a href="python.html#check">check</a> and
     <a href="python.html#note">note</a>.
<li> The <a href="python.html#putcells">putcells</a> command has optional
     parameters, including a new mode parameter.
<li> Clicked lexicon patterns are loaded into a separate "lexicon" layer
     (and the clipboard is no longer changed).
<li> If a pattern has been modified then its layer name is prefixed with an asterisk
     and a "save changes" dialog will appear before certain actions, such as
     opening a pattern file or quitting Golly.  The dialog can be disabled
     via check boxes in <a href="prefs:layer">Preferences > Layer</a>.
<li> Scrolling is optional if the pencil/cross/hand cursor is dragged outside

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 1.1 (released November 2006)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Added Save Extended RLE option (initially ticked) to the File menu.
     An extended RLE file stores the pattern position and generation count
     (if > 0) so they can be restored when the file is loaded.
<li> Macrocell files also store the generation count if > 0.
<li> Non-extended RLE files are now loaded so that 0,0 is at the top left
     corner of the pattern rather than in the middle of the pattern.
<li> Golly can read BMP/GIF/PNG/TIFF files and paste bitmap data.
     All non-white pixels become live cells.
<li> Golly can read pattern files using David Bell's dblife format.
<li> Starting patterns are saved in a temporary file rather than in memory.
     This is much faster when hashing (saving a macrocell file is very quick).
<li> Random Fill is much faster in typical cases.
<li> Escape key can be used to stop generating.
<li> Numerous additions and updates to the pattern collection.
<li> Added fuse-watcher.py, metafier.py and shift.py to the Scripts folder.
<li> More mouse interaction is allowed while a script is running.
     A script can be aborted by clicking the stop button in the tool bar
     or by selecting Stop in the Control menu.
<li> Resizing the help window no longer changes the scroll position.
<li> Fixed a bug loading huge macrocell files.
<li> Fixed an obscure bug in the non-hashing algorithm.
<li> Path to Scripts folder is only added to Python's sys.path once.
<li> Fixed rect bug in Scripts/glife/__init__.py (thanks to Dan Hoey).
<li> Golly's code can be compiled with a Unicode build of wxWidgets.
</ul>
