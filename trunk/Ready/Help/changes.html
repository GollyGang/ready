<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.3 (not yet released - use svn to get the source)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> RD can now be run on the surface of meshes, or in a volume of tetrahedral cells.
<li> New patterns: 
  <ul>
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/bays_3D.vti">bays_3D.vti</a>, implements a 3D cellular automaton.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/FitzHugh-Nagumo/Ising_regime.vti">Ising_regime.vti</a>
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/munafo-uskate.vti">munafo-uskate.vti</a>, Robert Munafo's glider in the U-Skate world.
  </ul>
<li> Meshes can now be exported as OBJ or VTP files - see File > Export Mesh...
<li> Can import meshes (*.obj, *.vtp, *.vtu) as surfaces to run RD on.
<li> <tt>use_image_interpolation=false</tt> now gives voxelised Minecraft-style rendering in 3D.
<li> New  <a href="formats.html#render_settings">render setting</a>: <tt>show_color_scale</tt> allows the color scale legend to be turned off.
<li> New overlay type: <a href="formats.html#pixel">pixel</a>, for specifying cells directly.
<li> The <a href="formats.html#overlay">overlay</a> element can now contain multiple shape specifiers.
<li> Image files (*.vti) can now be loaded into Paraview, with named chemicals ('a', 'b', etc.) and now can be visualized by volume rendering and contoured.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.2.2 (released March 2012)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Fixed issue that gave 'Invalid work group size' and 'expecting CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE to be a power of 2' errors on different graphics cards.
<li> Fixed XML-escaping issue that caused saved patterns to fail to load.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.2 (released March 2012)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1D patterns now supported, as a color strip and a line graph.
<li> Patterns can be saved and loaded, as VTK image data files (*.vti) extended with
     an extra XML element called "RD" - see <a href="formats.html">formats.html</a>
<li> Toolbars added, for common functions.
<li> Switched to a more flexible scheme for storing user preferences in a file
     called ReadyPrefs.  See <a href="file.html#prefs">here</a> for more details.
<li> Added a <a href="prefs:">Preferences</a> dialog for changing various settings,
     including keyboard shortcuts.
<li> Added File > New Pattern for setting the pattern to zeros.
<li> Added File > Open Recent submenu.
<li> Added View > Full Screen for toggling full screen mode.
<li> Added View > Fit Pattern to fill the view with the entire pattern.
<li> Added View > Wireframe for toggling from wireframe to surface view. Many other render settings can be changed in the Info Pane.
<li> Added Action > Reset to restore a pattern back to its starting point.
<li> Some menu items have been moved or renamed.
<li> The Patterns Pane no longer shows inbuilt demos.  It now shows files stored in the supplied
     Patterns folder.  Ctrl/right-clicking on a file will open it in your preferred text editor
     (set in <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>).  You can also add your own pattern
     folder via File > Add My Patterns.
<li> The Info Pane allows you to edit a rule's parameters and other properties while it is running.
<li> The Help Pane displays .html files stored in the Help folder via corresponding items
     in the Help menu.
<li> An Initial Pattern Generator is stored in the file and can be run to make new starting patterns.
     A series of overlays are composed in the different chemical images, and may include randomness.
<li> A new rule type "kernel" allows full OpenCL kernels to be specified, for maximum flexibility.
<li> The world size can now be changed. Set x, y or z to 1 for 2D or 1D systems, e.g. 128x1x1
<li> For 2D systems, all the chemicals are shown side-by-side. This can be turned off in the render settings.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.1 (released January 2012)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Includes 2D and 3D Gray-Scott demos.
<li> CPU and OpenCL implementations.
<li> User can select from available OpenCL devices (GPUs or CPUs).
<li> OpenCL is loaded at runtime, so we can still do something even if it is not available.
<li> User can edit OpenCL kernel and apply it to the running system.
<li> 3D visualisation shows a volume contoured at a fixed value, and a slice from the middle
     rendered as an image.
<li> 2D visualisation shows a false-color image and a height-mapped mesh on the back.
<li> Works on Windows XP+, Linux and MacOS 10.6+.
</ul>
