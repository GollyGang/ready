<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.3 (not yet released - use svn to get the source)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> RD can now be run on the surface of meshes, or in a volume of tetrahedral cells.
<li> New patterns: 
  <ul>
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/bays_3D.vti">bays_3D.vti</a>, implements a 3D cellular automaton.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/FitzHugh-Nagumo/Ising_regime.vti">Ising_regime.vti</a>, showing how tiny
  variation can grow into large meanders in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/munafo-uskate.vti">munafo-uskate.vti</a>, Robert Munafo's glider in the 
  U-Skate world.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/grayscott_parameter_map.vti">grayscott_parameter_map.vti</a>, showing 
  how the parameters affect the Gray-Scott system.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/turing_noisy.vti">turing_noisy.vti</a>, showing 
  the effect of noise on Turing patterns.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/grayscott_lesmes_noisy.vti">grayscott_lesmes_noisy.vti</a>, showing 
  how noise can change the behavior of reaction-diffusion systems.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/grayscott_noisy_solitons_mitosis.vti">grayscott_noisy_solitons_mitosis.vti</a>, showing 
  how noise can trigger solitons to replicate.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/mutually-catalytic_spots.vti">mutually-catalytic_spots.vti</a>, where 
  big spots can only replicate if full of small spots.
  <li><a href="open:Patterns/parameter_modulation_demo.vti">parameter_modulation_demo.vti</a>, showing how
  values in an extra chemical can be used to modulate the parameters of a system.
  </ul>
<li> <tt>use_image_interpolation=false</tt> now gives voxelised Minecraft-style rendering in 3D.
<li> New <a href="formats.html#render_settings">render settings</a>:
<ul>
<li><tt>show_color_scale</tt>: allows the color scale legend to be turned off.
<li><tt>color_displacement_mapped_surface</tt>: allows the displacement-mapped surface (for 2D 
    images) to be colored using the image.
</ul>
<li> New overlay shape: <a href="formats.html#pixel">pixel</a>, for specifying cells directly.
<li> New overlay fill: <a href="formats.html#linear_gradient">linear_gradient</a>, for 
    spatially-varying values.
<li> Each <a href="formats.html#overlay">overlay</a> element can now contain multiple shape 
    specifiers.
<li> Pattern files (*.vti, *.vtu) can now be loaded into Paraview correctly, with named chemicals 
    ('a', 'b', etc.). There they can be visualized by volume rendering, or contoured in various ways.
<li> Ready has a new (much nicer!) icon.
<li> New menu commands:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="file.html#File_ReloadFromDisk">File > Reload from Disk</a> : reloads the current 
  pattern file from the saved version on disk.
  <li><a href="file.html#File_ImportMesh">File > Import Mesh</a> : imports mesh files (*.obj, *.vtp, 
  *.vtu) as surfaces to run RD on.
  <li><a href="file.html#File_ExportMesh">File > Export Mesh</a> : exports a mesh file (*.obj, *.vtp) 
  from the current contoured surface or displacement-mapped surface.
  <li><a href="file.html#File_ExportImage">File > Export Image</a> : exports an image file (*.png, *.jpg) 
  from the current slice or 2D system.
  <li><a href="file.html#File_StartRecording">File > Start Recording...</a> : saves an image out every 
  frame, for making videos.
  <li><a href="file.html#File_StopRecording">File > Stop Recording</a> : stops saving out images.
  </ul>
<li> New option for image-based systems: <a href="formats.html#rule">wrap</a>, to toggle toroidal 
    wrap-around on/off.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.2.2 (released March 2012)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Fixed issue that gave 'Invalid work group size' and 'expecting CL_KERNEL_WORK_GROUP_SIZE to be 
    a power of 2' errors on different graphics cards.
<li> Fixed XML-escaping issue that caused saved patterns to fail to load.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.2 (released March 2012)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1D patterns now supported, as a color strip and a line graph.
<li> Patterns can be saved and loaded, as VTK image data files (*.vti) extended with
     an extra XML element called "RD" - see <a href="formats.html">formats.html</a>
<li> Toolbars added, for common functions.
<li> Switched to a more flexible scheme for storing user preferences in a file
     called ReadyPrefs.  See <a href="file.html#prefs">here</a> for more details.
<li> Added a <a href="prefs:">Preferences</a> dialog for changing various settings,
     including keyboard shortcuts.
<li> Added File > New Pattern for setting the pattern to zeros.
<li> Added File > Open Recent submenu.
<li> Added View > Full Screen for toggling full screen mode.
<li> Added View > Fit Pattern to fill the view with the entire pattern.
<li> Added View > Wireframe for toggling from wireframe to surface view. Many other render settings 
    can be changed in the Info Pane.
<li> Added Action > Reset to restore a pattern back to its starting point.
<li> Some menu items have been moved or renamed.
<li> The Patterns Pane no longer shows inbuilt demos.  It now shows files stored in the supplied
     Patterns folder.  Ctrl/right-clicking on a file will open it in your preferred text editor
     (set in <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>).  You can also add your own pattern
     folder via File > Add My Patterns.
<li> The Info Pane allows you to edit a rule's parameters and other properties while it is running.
<li> The Help Pane displays .html files stored in the Help folder via corresponding items
     in the Help menu.
<li> An Initial Pattern Generator is stored in the file and can be run to make new starting patterns.
     A series of overlays are composed in the different chemical images, and may include randomness.
<li> A new rule type "kernel" allows full OpenCL kernels to be specified, for maximum flexibility.
<li> The world size can now be changed. Set x, y or z to 1 for 2D or 1D systems, e.g. 128x1x1
<li> For 2D systems, all the chemicals are shown side-by-side. This can be turned off in the render 
    settings.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 0.1 (released January 2012)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Includes 2D and 3D Gray-Scott demos.
<li> CPU and OpenCL implementations.
<li> User can select from available OpenCL devices (GPUs or CPUs).
<li> OpenCL is loaded at runtime, so we can still do something even if it is not available.
<li> User can edit OpenCL kernel and apply it to the running system.
<li> 3D visualisation shows a volume contoured at a fixed value, and a slice from the middle
     rendered as an image.
<li> 2D visualisation shows a false-color image and a height-mapped mesh on the back.
<li> Works on Windows XP+, Linux and MacOS 10.6+.
</ul>
