<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1D patterns now supported, as a color strip and a line graph.
<li> Patterns can be saved and loaded, as VTK image data files (*.vti) extended with
     an extra XML element called "RD".
<li> Toolbars added, for common functions.
<li> Switched to a more flexible scheme for storing user preferences in a file
     called ReadyPrefs.  See <a href="file.html#prefs">here</a> for more details.
<li> Added a <a href="prefs:">Preferences</a> dialog for changing various settings,
     including keyboard shortcuts.
<li> Added File > New Pattern command for setting the pattern to zeros.
<li> Added File > Open Recent submenu.
<li> Added View > Full Screen command for toggling full screen mode.
<li> Added Action > Reset command to restore a pattern back to its starting point.
<li> Some menu items have been moved or renamed.
<li> Added an Edit menu with the usual items.
<li> The Rule Pane allows you to edit a rule's parameters and other properties while it is running.
<li> The Help Pane displays .html files stored in the Help folder via corresponding items
     in the Help menu.
<li> The Patterns Pane no longer shows inbuilt demos.  It now shows files stored in the supplied
     Patterns folder.  Ctrl/right-clicking on a file will open it in your preferred text editor
     (set in <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>).
<li> An Initial Pattern Generator is stored in the file and can be run to make new starting patterns.
     A series of overlays are composed in the different chemical images, and may include randomness.
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Includes 2D and 3D Gray-Scott demos.
<li> CPU and OpenCL implementations.
<li> User can select from available OpenCL devices (GPUs or CPUs).
<li> OpenCL is loaded at runtime, so we can still do something even if it is not available.
<li> User can edit OpenCL kernel and apply it to the running system.
<li> 3D visualisation shows a volume contoured at a fixed value, and a slice from the middle
     rendered as an image.
<li> 2D visualisation shows a false-color image and a height-mapped mesh on the back.
<li> Works on Windows XP+, Linux and MacOS 10.6+.
