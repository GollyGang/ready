<p>
<font size=+1><b>New Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Creates a new, empty universe and switches to a scale suitable for editing cells.
Use <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a> to set the scale (initially 1:16),
the cursor mode, and whether any selection should be removed.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Pattern...</b></font>

<p>
Opens the standard file browser so you can select a pattern file.
Golly can read all the common pattern formats:
RLE, PC Life 1.05/1.06, dblife, some MCell files, and text patterns like "ooo...ooo".
It can also read patterns in a "macrocell" format which allows huge,
highly repetitive patterns to be stored in a very compact way.
Such files usually have a .mc extension.  If a .mc file contains timeline data
then Golly will load all the frames and automatically show the timeline bar.

<p>
All the above formats are text based and can have DOS/Mac/Unix line endings,
or they can be compressed in a .gz file.

<p>
Golly can also read graphic files in a number of popular formats:
BMP, GIF, PNG and TIFF.  The file name must end with an appropriate extension:
.bmp, .gif, .png, .tif or .tiff.
All the pure white pixels (RGB = 255,255,255) are treated as cells of state 0.
All other pixels are treated as cells of state 1.
This can be handy if you prefer to use a sophisticated drawing program
to create your patterns.

<p>
Use <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a> to set the cursor mode,
and whether any selection should be removed.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Clipboard</b></font>

<p>
Opens a pattern stored in the clipboard.
The <a href="refs.html">References</a> section has links to
a number of good sources for clipboard patterns.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Recent</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you open a recently loaded pattern file.
The most recent file is always at the top.
The maximum number of pattern files remembered is determined by a setting
(initially 20) which you can change in <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Patterns</b></font>

<p>
if ticked then a scrollable pattern folder is displayed next to the viewport.
Clicking on a pattern file will load it in.  The initial pattern folder is
the Patterns collection supplied with Golly.  If you have your own collection
then use Set Pattern Folder (see below) to select a different folder.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Set Pattern Folder...</b></font>

<p>
Lets you change the pattern folder displayed by Show Patterns (see above).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Save Pattern...</b></font>

<p>
Opens the standard file saving dialog so you can save the current pattern
in RLE format (but only if all live cells are within coordinates of +/- 1 billion),
or in macrocell format if the current algorithm supports hashing (all algorithms
except QuickLife).  Note that if a timeline exists when you save a .mc file then
<em>all</em> the frames will be stored in the file.

<p>
You also have the option of saving patterns as compressed files
(.rle.gz or .mc.gz).

<a name="xrle"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Save Extended RLE</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, Golly will include additional information whenever it saves
a pattern in an RLE file via the above Save Pattern item or the
<b>save</b>/<b>store</b> script commands.
The pattern's position is recorded, along with the current generation count
if it's greater than zero.  This allows Golly to restore the pattern's
position and generation count when the file is loaded at a later date.
The extra information is stored in a special "#CXRLE" comment line at the
start of the file.  Because it's a comment, other RLE-reading programs
should have no problem loading such files.

<p>
Note that if the current grid is bounded (ie. has a finite width or height)
then Golly ignores this item's setting and always records the pattern's
position so it can be restored when the file is loaded.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Run Script...</b></font>

<p>
Opens the standard file browser so you can run a selected Perl or Python script.
Such scripts can be used to automate or extend Golly's user interface,
or to construct complex patterns.  A number of sample scripts are provided
in the Scripts folder.  More details about Golly's scripting capabilities
can be found in the <a href="perl.html">Perl Scripting</a> and
<a href="python.html">Python Scripting</a> help topics.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Run Clipboard</b></font>

<p>
Runs the Perl or Python script stored in the clipboard.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Run Recent</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you run a recently executed script file.
The most recent script is always at the top.
The maximum number of scripts remembered is determined by a setting
(initially 20) which you can change in <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Scripts</b></font>

<p>
if ticked then a scrollable script folder is displayed next to the viewport.
Clicking on a Perl or Python script file will execute it.  The initial script folder
is the Scripts folder supplied with Golly.  If you want to write your own scripts
then best to do so in a new folder and use Set Script Folder (see below)
to select that folder.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Set Script Folder...</b></font>

<p>
Lets you change the script folder displayed by Show Scripts (see above).

<a name="prefs"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Preferences...</b></font>

<p>
Opens the <a href="prefs:">Preferences</a> dialog so you can change various settings.
[On the Mac, this item is in the application menu.]
All your settings are stored in a file called GollyPrefs.  This file is initially
saved in a user-specific data directory:
<p>
<dd>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td>On Linux:</td><td width=20>
    </td><td>~/.golly/</td></tr>
<tr><td>On Mac:</td><td width=20>
    </td><td>~/Library/Application Support/Golly/</td></tr>
<tr><td>On Windows:</td><td width=20>
    </td><td>C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Golly\</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>
<p>
You might prefer to move GollyPrefs into the same folder as the application.
This allows multiple copies of Golly to have their own set of preferences.
