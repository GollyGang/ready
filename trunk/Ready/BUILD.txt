Ready uses CMake as a pre-build setup. You might need to read some
CMake documentation to get the hang of it. We've put some hints
below.

Dependencies: VTK, wxWidgets, any OpenCL SDK.

=========================== Windows =================================

1. Open CMake (cmake-gui.exe)
2. Create a build folder, locate the source folder
3. Hit configure.
4. Select a compiler (e.g. Visual Studio 2008)
5. Check the variables that go red.
6. Help CMake find things. Hit configure again.
7. Eventually hit generate to generate the build files.
8. Build in your chosen package. (e.g. open the .sln and build)

=========================== Linux =================================

mkdir Ready_build
cd Ready_build
cmake ../Ready_source_folder
make

Alternatively, use ccmake or cmake-gui.

=========================== MacOS =================================

1. To avoid the error "-- Could NOT find wxWidgets (missing:  wxWidgets_FOUND)", 
   manually build and install wxWidgets 2.9 even if you already have an 
   wxWidgets that works for other projects:

 cd
 cd devt    # A directory for things I download and build but do not checkout/modify/checkin
 svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk wx-trunk
 cd wx-trunk
 mkdir build-osx
 cd build-osx
 ../configure --enable-unicode --disable-shared --with-osx_cocoa
 make    # Take a nap, it'll be a while
 sudo make install

2. If you have not already done do, build VTK 5.8 (no install is needed in this 
   case because we supply the option "-DVTK_DIR:PATH=$HOME/devt/VTK/build" when 
   cmake'ing Ready)

 cd
 cd devt    # A directory for things I download and build but do not checkout/modify/checkin
 curl 'http://www.vtk.org/files/release/5.8/vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz' > vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz
 gunzip vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz
 tar -xvf vtk-5.8.0.tar        # (creates directory ./VTK)
 cd VTK
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make     # This also takes some time

3. Then do this to get, configure and build Ready (assuming VTK was built in 
   ~/devt/VTK as shown above):

 cd
 cd proj    # A directory for projects I am "working on"
 svn checkout https://reaction-diffusion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reaction-diffusion --username $MYEMAIL
 #
 # Or if not a project member do:
 # svn checkout http://reaction-diffusion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reaction-diffusion-read-only
 # And substitute "reaction-diffusion-read-only" for "reaction-diffusion" in the following
 #
 cd reaction-diffusion
 mkdir Ready_gui_build
 cd !$
 cmake ../reaction-diffusion/Ready -DVTK_DIR:PATH=$HOME/devt/VTK/build
 make

4. Finally, "open ." which will show the current directory in the Finder, and 
   you should see the Ready icon. However my Finder will not let me run it, so I just type:

 ./Ready.app/Contents/MacOS/Ready
