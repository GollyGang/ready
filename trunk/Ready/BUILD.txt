Dependencies: 
0) CMake: www.cmake.org
1) VTK: www.vtk.org
2) wxWidgets (2.9.2+): www.wxwidgets.org
3) any OpenCL SDK.

Ready uses CMake as a pre-build setup. You might need to read some
CMake documentation first to get the hang of it.

=============== Windows, using the Visual Studio IDE =================

A) Build VTK:
 - Use CMake (cmake-gui.exe) and make a separate build folder. Use the 
   Visual Studio generator that corresponds to whichever version you
   have installed.
 - Set BUILD_TESTING to off (we don't need it). 
 - Ensure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off.
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and 
   similar. Change all occurences of /MD (if any) to /MT, and /MDd to 
   /MTd. This ensures that the C runtime is statically-linked, so we 
   don't need to distribute them too.
 - Generate, then open the resulting VTK.sln and build the Debug and 
   Release targets.
 
B) Build wxWidgets:
 - From the Start menu, open a Visual Studio command prompt.
 - cd c:\wxWidgets\build\msw (or equivalent for your installation)
 - Build both the release and debug versions:
   For 32-bit:
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=1 DEBUG_FLAG=1
   For 64-bit:
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0 TARGET_CPU=AMD64
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=1 DEBUG_FLAG=1 TARGET_CPU=AMD64
 
C) Build Ready:
 - Run CMake and make a separate build folder for Ready.
 - Set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to your wxWidgets installation folder, if 
   CMake didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to e.g. c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_lib, if CMake 
   didn't find the right version automatically.
 - wxWidgets_USE_REL_AND_DBG should be checked.
 - Set VTK_DIR to the build folder of VTK, if CMake didn't find the 
   right version automatically.
 - Set OPENCL_LIBRARIES to the location of a suitable OpenCL.lib, e.g.
    E:/NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.1/OpenCL/common/lib/Win32/OpenCL.lib
 - Set OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS to e.g.
    E:/NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.1/OpenCL/common/inc
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Change all /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd
 - Generate, then open the resulting Ready.sln and build the Debug and
   Release targets. Set Ready as the "StartUp Project" to have it run
   by default.
 - Build the PACKAGE target to build the distributable binary zip. The
   source package doesn't seem to be supported by CMake in the IDE yet,
   so use the command-line approach below for this.
   
For 64-bit builds:
- select the 64-bit generators in CMake
- use the 64-bit version of OpenCL.lib
- c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_lib is now c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_amd64_lib

================ Windows, using the command-line =====================

A) Build VTK:
 - From the Start menu, open a Visual Studio command prompt and type:
    cmake-gui
 - Create a target build folder, and select NMake Makefiles as the 
   generator.
 - Set BUILD_TESTING to off (we don't need it). 
 - Ensure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off.
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and 
   similar. Change all occurences of /MD (if any) to /MT, and /MDd to 
   /MTd. This ensures that the C runtime is statically-linked, so we 
   don't need to distribute them too.
 - Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
 - Configure, generate, then build with NMake from the build folder:
    nmake
    
 Prior to MSVC 8 (2005) the default (we think) was to link the runtime 
 statically (/MT), so for older versions of MSVC you can use the simpler 
 method of:
    cd c:\vtk
    mkdir vtk-build
    cd vtk-build
    cmake ..
    nmake
   
B) Build wxWidgets:
 - From the Start menu, open a Visual Studio command prompt.
 - cd c:\wxWidgets\build\msw (or equivalent for your installation)
 - Build the release version:   
   For 32-bit:
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0
   For 64-bit:
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0 TARGET_CPU=AMD64
    
C) Build Ready:
 - From the Start menu, open a Visual Studio command prompt and type:
    cmake-gui
 - Create a target build folder, and select NMake Makefiles as the 
   generator.
 - Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
 - Set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to your wxWidgets installation folder, if 
   CMake didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to e.g. c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_lib, if CMake 
   didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set VTK_DIR to the build folder of VTK.
 - Set OPENCL_LIBRARIES to the location of a suitable OpenCL.lib, e.g.
    E:/NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.1/OpenCL/common/lib/Win32/OpenCL.lib
 - Set OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS to e.g.
    E:/NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 4.1/OpenCL/common/inc
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Change all /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd
 - Configure, generate, quit.
 - Build Ready:
    nmake
 - Build the binary and source distributables:
    nmake package
    nmake package_source

For 64-bit builds:
- use the 64-bit Visual Studio command prompt
- use the 64-bit version of OpenCL.lib
- c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_lib is now c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_amd64_lib

=========================== Linux =================================

Install: libvtk, libwxgtk (2.9+), any OpenCL SDK.

mkdir Ready_build
cd Ready_build
cmake ../Ready_source_folder
make

(Alternatively, use ccmake or cmake-gui for configuring.)

make package
make package_source

If you need to build wxWidgets yourself (if your distribution
doesn't come with a recent enough version) then this is the method
you'll need:

cd wxWidgets
./configure --with-gtk --disable-shared --enable-unicode
make

This produces the wx-config file that CMake needs.

=========================== MacOS =================================

1. To avoid the error "-- Could NOT find wxWidgets (missing:  wxWidgets_FOUND)", 
   manually build and install wxWidgets 2.9 even if you already have an 
   wxWidgets that works for other projects:

 cd
 cd devt    # A directory for things I download and build but do not checkout/modify/checkin
 svn checkout http://svn.wxwidgets.org/svn/wx/wxWidgets/trunk wx-trunk
 cd wx-trunk
 mkdir build-osx
 cd build-osx
 ../configure --enable-unicode --disable-shared --with-osx_cocoa
 make    # Take a nap, it'll be a while
 sudo make install

2. If you have not already done do, build VTK 5.8 (no install is needed in this 
   case because we supply the option "-DVTK_DIR:PATH=$HOME/devt/VTK/build" when 
   cmake'ing Ready)

 cd
 cd devt    # A directory for things I download and build but do not checkout/modify/checkin
 curl 'http://www.vtk.org/files/release/5.8/vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz' > vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz
 gunzip vtk-5.8.0.tar.gz
 tar -xvf vtk-5.8.0.tar        # (creates directory ./VTK)
 cd VTK
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make     # This also takes some time

3. Then do this to get, configure and build Ready (assuming VTK was built in 
   ~/devt/VTK as shown above):

 cd
 cd proj    # A directory for projects I am "working on"
 svn checkout https://reaction-diffusion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reaction-diffusion --username $MYEMAIL
 #
 # Or if not a project member do:
 # svn checkout http://reaction-diffusion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ reaction-diffusion-read-only
 # And substitute "reaction-diffusion-read-only" for "reaction-diffusion" in the following
 #
 mkdir Ready_gui_build
 cd Ready_gui_build
 cmake ../reaction-diffusion/Ready -DVTK_DIR:PATH=$HOME/devt/VTK/build
 make
 open Ready.app
