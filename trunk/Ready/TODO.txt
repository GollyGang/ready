before 0.1 release:

before 0.x release
- file format for saving/loading rules and patterns
- populate a pattern library (primary UI for beginners is a list of examples to click)
- control over size of world, running speed
- make a toolbar of icons for commonly-used functions

before 1.0 release:
- copy/paste (2d only) (paste modes: add, overwrite)
- allow user to paint, erase, even while running (2D only)
- control over render pipeline: contouring level, color map, active components etc.
- control over boundary conditions: wrap-around or constant value
- save out videos
- save out scene (e.g. OBJ) for external render
- SSE for non-OpenCL implementations (will assume all target cpus support SSE)

future ideas:
- allow user to change OpenCL platform and device while a pattern is running
- parameter map(s) in a separate window, to allow user to explore parameters 
- full control over scene graph; nodes+connections interface
- different topologies: e.g. arbitrary 2d mesh embedded in 3d: zebra, etc.
- parameters driven by an input scene (for writhing logos, etc.)
- multi-stage, multi-scale RD
- radiosity rendering for better visualization of tangled structures
- STL output, email file to shapeways for printing
- 1D RD
- discrete RD (simulation of individual chemicals, to compare with differential equations)
