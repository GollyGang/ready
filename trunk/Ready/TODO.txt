UI annoyances:
- edit formula dialog: want tab key to indent (doesn't work on Windows), want indent to be smart ideally
- never want dialogs to appear partially off-screen
- need some way to refresh the Patterns Pane, other than collapse/expand on the folders?
- 1D line graph: some lines appear black on first render (but only on Tim's Win7/Debian PC!?)
- on some platforms (Windows XP, AMD driver only?) terminal windows appear on pattern load
- on Windows, Ready application gets pushed into background on first pattern load
- can't tab between edit controls in XYZ dialogs on Xubuntu

code annoyances:
- ImageRD::UpdateImageWrapPad() shouldn't be necessary

before 0.3 release:

- switch all vti files to use single-component named scalar arrays (as in MeshRD) 
   - enables paraview to contour them, also easier to deal with (only need a single image)
- different topologies: arbitrary connectivity (allows 3d zebra, hex tiling, sphere, etc.)
- relax power of 2 size requirement (only a speed benefit)
- image import (user can specify how colors map onto chemicals), import Robert's patterns
- parameter map(s) in a separate window, to allow user to explore parameters 
- some way to add noise to the system on each frame, or periodically (for Turing and Meinhardt, especially)
- new overlay fill type: horizontal/vertical gradient, for spiral seeds, as here:
  http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/misc-images/2d-spiral-seeds.jpg
- parameters driven by an input scene (for writhing logos, etc.) - can use more chemicals for this

- implement suggested_running_speed (tu/s) instead of timesteps_per_render
- add toolbar icons for: faster, slower, change running speed - need artwork :(
- add initial_pattern_generator to Info Pane for editing
- add option to convert formula rules into full-kernel rules


before 0.x release:
- use better (big) toolbar icons in Mac app
- fix Mac bug: can't disable tooltips (bug is in wxOSX-Cocoa)
- improve wxHtmlWindow so selected text goes gray on loss of focus (Mac only?)
- allow user to change the default render settings
- image export (user can specify how chemicals map onto colors)
- multi-stage, multi-scale RD (McCabe, Kytta, Woitzel)
- graphical UI for editing the initial-pattern-generator overlay stack
- export rule to the WebGL playground template

before 1.0 release:
- use_image_interpolation=false should give city blocks in the displacement-mapped surface?
- create nicer app icon (need at least 128x128 image for Mac, then scale down for smaller icons)
- lots of patterns in library (primary UI for beginners is a list of examples to click)
- copy/paste (2d only) (paste modes: add, overwrite)
- allow user to paint, erase, even while running (2D only)
- control over boundary conditions: wrap-around or constant value
- save out videos
- SSE for non-OpenCL implementations (will assume all target cpus support SSE)

future ideas:
- bug: allow user to change OpenCL platform and device while a pattern is running
- full control over scene graph, e.g. nodes+connections interface
- radiosity rendering for better visualization of tangled structures (embed a raytracer)
- STL output, email file to shapeways for printing
- discrete RD (simulation of individual chemicals, to compare with differential equations)
- display the evolution of a 1D pattern as a 2D image, with time as the second axis, as here:
  http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/recent/specialfunctions/images/Slide028_917x754.gif
- allow non-OpenCL implementations to load all files, by parsing formula
- integer systems
- read Golly rule tables
