Dependencies:
0) CMake (latest version, or at least 3.3): www.cmake.org
1) VTK (latest version, or at least 6.2): www.vtk.org
2) wxWidgets (latest version, or at least 2.9.2): www.wxwidgets.org
3) any OpenCL SDK.

Ready uses CMake for pre-build setup. You might need to read some CMake
documentation first to get the hang of it.

=============== Windows, using the Visual Studio IDE =================

A) Build VTK:
 - Use CMake (cmake-gui.exe) and make a separate build folder, e.g. C:\VTK\build
 - Hit Configure and select the Visual Studio generator that corresponds
   to whichever version you have installed (64 bit if using).
 - Ensure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off.
 - Ensure BUILD_TESTING is off (saves time).
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_* and CMAKE_C_*. Change all
   occurences of /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd. This ensures that the C runtime
   is statically-linked, so we don't need to distribute it.
 - Hit Generate, then open the resulting VTK.sln and build the Debug and
   Release targets.

B) Build wxWidgets:
 - Open a 32/64-bit Visual Studio command prompt. (Google this if needed.)
 - cd c:\wxWidgets\build\msw (or equivalent for your installation)
 - Build both the release and debug versions:
   For 32-bit: (in a 32-bit Visual Studio command prompt)
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=1 DEBUG_FLAG=1
   For 64-bit: (in a 64-bit Visual Studio command prompt)
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0 TARGET_CPU=AMD64
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=1 DEBUG_FLAG=1 TARGET_CPU=AMD64

C) Build Ready:
 - Run CMake and make a separate build folder for Ready.
 - Set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to your wxWidgets installation folder, if
   CMake didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to e.g. c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_lib (vc_x64_lib if using 64-bit).
 - wxWidgets_USE_REL_AND_DBG should be checked.
 - Set VTK_DIR to the build folder of VTK, if CMake didn't find the
   right version automatically.
 - Set OPENCL_LIBRARIES to the location of a suitable OpenCL.lib, e.g.
    C:/CUDA/lib/OpenCL.lib, or C:/CUDA/lib64/OpenCL.lib for 64-bit.
 - Set OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS to e.g.
    C:/CUDA/include
 - Generate, then open the resulting Ready.sln and build the Debug and
   Release targets. Set Ready as the "StartUp Project" to have it run
   by default.
 - Build the PACKAGE target to build the distributable binary zip. The
   source package doesn't seem to be supported by CMake in the IDE yet,
   so use the command-line approach below for this.

================ Windows, using the command-line =====================

A) Build VTK:
 - Open a 32/64-bit Visual Studio command prompt and type: cmake-gui
 - Create a target build folder, and select NMake Makefiles as the
   generator.
 - Ensure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off.
 - Ensure BUILD_TESTING to off (saves time).
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and
   similar. Change all occurences of /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd.
   This ensures that the C runtime is statically-linked, so we don't
   need to distribute it.
 - Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
 - Configure, Generate, then close CMake and build with NMake from
   the build folder: nmake

B) Build wxWidgets:
 - Open a 32/64-bit Visual Studio command prompt.
 - cd c:\wxWidgets\build\msw (or equivalent for your installation)
 - Build the release version:
   For 32-bit: (in a 32-bit Visual Studio command prompt)
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0
   For 64-bit: (in a 64-bit Visual Studio command prompt)
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0 TARGET_CPU=AMD64

C) Build Ready:
 - Open a 32/64-bit Visual Studio command prompt and type: cmake-gui
 - Create a target build folder, and select NMake Makefiles as the
   generator.
 - Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
 - Set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to your wxWidgets installation folder, if
   CMake didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to e.g. c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_lib (vc_x64_lib if 64-bit).
 - Set VTK_DIR to the build folder of VTK.
 - Set OPENCL_LIBRARIES to the location of a suitable OpenCL.lib, e.g.
    C:/CUDA/lib/OpenCL.lib, or C:/CUDA/lib64/OpenCL.lib for 64-bit.
 - Set OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS to e.g.
    C:/CUDA/include
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and
   similar. Change all occurences of /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd.
   This ensures that the C runtime is statically-linked.
 - Configure, Generate, then exit CMake.
 - Build Ready:
    nmake
 - Build the binary and source distributables:
    nmake package
    nmake package_source

B) Download and build Ready:

mkdir Ready
cd Ready

cd build
ccmake ../ready

make

Optional, for packaging:

1. Build wxWidgets (assuming you've downloaded and unpacked the source tar ball
   for wxWidgets 3.0.2 from https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/):

cd /path/to/wxWidgets-3.0.2
mkdir build-osx
cd build-osx
../configure --enable-unicode --disable-shared --with-osx_cocoa
make   # take a nap, it'll be a while

   http://www.vtk.org/download/):

cd /path/to/VTK-6.3.0
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
make   # this also takes some time

cd ready
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DVTK_DIR:PATH=/path/to/VTK-6.3.0/build
