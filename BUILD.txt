Dependencies:
0) CMake (latest version, or at least 3.3): www.cmake.org
1) VTK (latest version, or at least 6.2): www.vtk.org
2) wxWidgets (latest version, or at least 2.9.2): www.wxwidgets.org
3) any OpenCL SDK (e.g. NVidia GPU Computing Toolkit)
4) Boost > 1.50

Ready uses CMake for pre-build setup. You might need to read some CMake
documentation first to get the hang of it.

=============== Windows 64-bit, using the Visual Studio IDE =================

A) Build VTK:
 - Use CMake (cmake-gui.exe) and make a separate build folder, e.g. C:\VTK\build
 - Hit Configure and select the Visual Studio generator that corresponds
   to whichever version you have installed (e.g. 2019 x64).
 - Ensure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off.
 - Ensure BUILD_TESTING is off (saves time).
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_* and CMAKE_C_*. Change all
   occurences of /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd. This ensures that the C runtime
   is statically-linked, so we don't need to distribute it.
 - Hit Configure again.
 - Hit Generate, then open the resulting VTK.sln and build the Debug and
   Release targets.

B) Build wxWidgets:
 - Open a 64-bit command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
 - cd c:\wxWidgets\build\msw (or equivalent for your installation)
 - Build both the release and debug versions:
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0 TARGET_CPU=AMD64
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=1 DEBUG_FLAG=1 TARGET_CPU=AMD64

C) Build Boost:
 - Open a 64-bit command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019":
    bootstrap
    b2 -j8 toolset=msvc-14.2 address-model=64 architecture=x86 link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static variant=release,debug --build-type=complete -a stage
    (example for 64-bit build using VS2019)
    (ignore that the output says "default address-model: 32-bit")

D) Build Ready:
 - Run CMake and make a separate build folder for Ready.
 - Set VTK_DIR to the build folder of VTK, if CMake didn't find the
   right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to your wxWidgets installation folder, if
   CMake didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to e.g. c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_x64_lib
 - wxWidgets_USE_REL_AND_DBG should be checked.
 - Set OPENCL_LIBRARIES to e.g.
    C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.2/lib/x64/OpenCL.lib
 - Set OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS to e.g.
    C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.2/include
 - Set Boost_INCLUDE_DIR to e.g. C:/boost_1_71_0
 - Generate, then open the resulting Ready.sln and build the Debug and
   Release targets. Set Ready as the "StartUp Project" to have it run
   by default.
 - Build the PACKAGE target to build the distributable binary zip. The
   source package doesn't seem to be supported by CMake in the IDE yet,
   so use the command-line approach below for this.

================ Windows 64-bit, using the command-line =====================

A) Build VTK:
 - Open a 64-bit command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
 - Type: cmake-gui
 - Create a target build folder, and select NMake Makefiles as the
   generator.
 - Ensure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off.
 - Ensure BUILD_TESTING to off (saves time).
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and
   similar. Change all occurences of /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd.
   This ensures that the C runtime is statically-linked, so we don't
   need to distribute it.
 - Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
 - Configure, Generate, then close CMake and build with NMake from
   the build folder: nmake

B) Build wxWidgets:
 - Open a 64-bit command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
 - cd c:\wxWidgets\build\msw (or equivalent for your installation)
 - Build the release version:
    nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=release RUNTIME_LIBS=static UNICODE=1 DEBUG_INFO=0 DEBUG_FLAG=0 TARGET_CPU=AMD64

C) Build Boost:
 - Open a 64-bit command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
    bootstrap
    b2 -j8 toolset=msvc-14.2 address-model=64 architecture=x86 link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static release --build-type=complete -a stage
    (example for 64-bit build using VS2019)
    (ignore that the output says "default address-model: 32-bit")

D) Build Ready:
 - Open a 64-bit command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019"
 - Type: cmake-gui
 - Create a target build folder, and select NMake Makefiles as the
   generator.
 - Set VTK_DIR to the build folder of VTK.
 - Set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Release
 - Set wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR to your wxWidgets installation folder, if
   CMake didn't find the right version automatically.
 - Set wxWidgets_LIB_DIR to e.g. c:\wxWidgets\lib\vc_x64_lib
 - Set OPENCL_LIBRARIES to e.g.
    C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.2/lib/x64/OpenCL.lib
 - Set OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS to e.g.
    C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v10.2/include
 - Set Boost_INCLUDE_DIR to e.g. C:/boost_1_71_0
 - Check the Advanced checkbox. Look for CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE and
   similar. Change all occurences of /MD to /MT, and /MDd to /MTd.
   This ensures that the C runtime is statically-linked.
 - Configure, Generate, then exit CMake.
 - Build Ready:
    nmake
 - Build the binary and source distributables:
    nmake package
    nmake package_source
