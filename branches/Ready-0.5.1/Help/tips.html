<title>Ready Help: Hints and Tips</title>
<body>

<p>
<h3>Some useful hints and tips</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>To view a pattern file just drop it onto the Ready app, or onto the
rendering window if the app is already running.
<li>Rendering complex scenes can be quite costly, so to increase the speed you can turn off the 
displacement mapped surfaces, and turn off the display of multiple chemicals. See the Render 
Settings in the Info Pane.
<li>For maximum speed, use <a href="action.html#Action_ChangeRunningSpeed">Change Running Speed...</a> 
in the Action menu to increase the number of timesteps between each render. Fewer frames will be 
drawn, and the overall speed will be faster.
<li>The patterns in the "CPU-only" folder typically run much slower than the others, if your 
graphics card is reasonable. So for better performance you shouldn't use them. (If you don't have 
OpenCL installed or you're in a virtual machine then only the CPU-only patterns will work.)
<li>Any image-based reaction-diffusion pattern (vti files, not yet the vtu mesh ones) can be changed in 
size using the dimensions control in the Info Pane. If you want the same behavior then usually some
of the parameters must be altered. Some examples:
    <ul>
    <li>With 
    <a href="open:Patterns/Gray-Scott/Pearson1993.vti">Gray-Scott/Pearson1993.vti</a> there is an explicit
    parameter for scale, delta_x, which is used in the formula. If you double the size of the pattern 
    (to 512x512x1), you can set delta_x to half (0.004883) to get the same pattern. For numerical 
    stability at the new size, change timestep to 0.3.
    <li>There is no explicit delta_x in <a href="open:Patterns/Gray-Scott/U-Skate/Munafo_glider.vti">Gray-Scott/U-Skate/Munafo_glider.vti</a>, 
    which is common way to write things as we don't often need it. Here you can double the size of the
    pattern (to 256x128x1) as long as you <i>quadruple</i> the diffusion parameters D_a and D_b to 
    0.656 and 0.328 respectively. And again a smaller timestep (e.g. 0.5) will be needed.
    </ul>
<li>To make a video, use the command on the File menu: <a href="file.html#File_StartRecording">Start 
Recording...</a> to produce a sequence of images. Then use your favorite utility to make a video 
file. For example in <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> the following command makes a high 
quality <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4">MPEG-4</a> video at 50 frames per second: 
<br><tt>ffmpeg -r 50 -i frame_%06d.png -sameq video.mp4</tt>
<li>If your 3D mesh resolution is too low, use an external tool like 
<a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net">MeshLab</a> to subdivide it before importing into Ready.
<li><a href="http://www.paraview.org">ParaView</a> can load the output of Ready (vtu and vti files) 
and has lots of filters to try. A method for making wrinkly rabbits was discussed 
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=945">here</a>.
