_This page will contain the results from the different implementations on different systems, allowing everyone to see how they compare._

To standardise the results we have chosen the Gray-Scott system, with toroidal topology. The figures are in Million cell-generations per second.

|| || Intel i7-2600 (4 cores, 8 threads) @ 3.4GHz, nVidia !GeForce GTX 460 ||
|| !GrayScott || 84 ||
|| !GrayScott_double || 87 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenMP || 250 ||
|| !GrayScott_SSE || 540 ||
|| !GrayScott_SSE_OpenMP || 1000 ||
|| !GrayScott_HWIVector || 432 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenCL || 820 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenCL_Image || 2300 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenCL_Image_2x2 || 4400 ||

Issues: 
  * Not all systems currently implement the toroidal topology.
  * The grid size affects the speed. 256x256 isn't big enough for some implementations - e.g. at 1024x1024 with `_OpenCL_Image_2x2` I get 4200 fps, the equivalent of 67000 fps on a 256x256 grid, but only 36000 fps on an actual 256x256 grid
