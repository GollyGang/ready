To standardise the results we have chosen the Gray-Scott system on a 256x256 grid, with toroidal topology. The figures are the framerate of the computation (higher is better).

|| || Intel i7-2600 (4 cores, 8 threads) @ 3.4GHz, nVidia !GeForce GTX 460 ||
|| !GrayScott || 1200 ||
|| !GrayScott_double || 700 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenMP || 4000 ||
|| !GrayScott_SSE || 8100 ||
|| !GrayScott_SSE_OpenMP || 16000 ||
|| !GrayScott_HWIVector || 6600 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenCL || 15000 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenCL_Image || 27000 ||
|| !GrayScott_OpenCL_Image_2x2 || 36000 ||

Issues: not all systems currently implement the toroidal topology.
